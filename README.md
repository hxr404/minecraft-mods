# About & Credits
This is a list of some popular Fabric Mods, that still maintains the "Vanilla" feel, mostly optimization mods.<br>
The optimizations part is based on [hxr404/fabric-optimization-mods-private](https://github.com/hxr404/fabric-optimization-mods-private/).<br>

~~I recently found this gist: https://gist.github.com/DragonEggBedrockBreaking/bfec74c0024be96d0ce2173ff06b695f. I'll include some of the mods listed there.~~<ins>The list was moved to GitLab: https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2175061</ins><br>
(GitLab is similar to GitHub, but better because it is 100% FOSS and not owned by Microsoft)<br>
