# About & Credits
This is a list of some popular Fabric Mods, that still maintains the "Vanilla" feel, mostly optimization mods.<br>
The optimizations part is based on [hxr404/fabric-optimization-mods-private](https://github.com/hxr404/fabric-optimization-mods-private/) (my fork of [ReperakPro's Mod list](https://github.com/ReperakPro/fabric-optimization-mods)), mods I discovered by myself, and the issues tab of ReperakPro's Mod list. Thanks to [DragonEggBedrockBreaking](https://github.com/DragonEggBedrockBreaking),  [Brottweiler](https://github.com/Brottweiler), [NebelNidads](https://github.com/NebelNidads) and [jiaaluo](https://github.com/jiaaluo) who wrote the issues.<br>Oh and I recently found this gist: https://gist.github.com/DragonEggBedrockBreaking/bfec74c0024be96d0ce2173ff06b695f. I'll include some of the mods listed there. Thanks @DragonEggBedrockBreaking
